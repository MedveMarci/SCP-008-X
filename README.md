# SCP-008-X
An EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that adds SCP-008 into the game. This is fundamentally for server hosts that want to add more a enganging SCP-049-2 experience for their players.
## How does it work?
It will give **SCP-049-2** the ability to infect it's targets on hit. The targets will receive a custom component that drains their health over time. In order to cure the infection, you must either use `SCP-500` for a guaranteed success or gamble with a `Medkit`'s 50% chance cure rate. Players that die while infected will spawn as SCP-049-2 as well.
